0,jadianes,0,5,Hands down the best whisky for under 100 dollars
1,jadianes,1,5,OUTSTANDING Islay
2,jadianes,3,5,I am very pleased when I come back home thinking my tongue crave in tasting a drop and my mind can't wait smoking a cigarette at the " lenght finish".
3,jadianes,9,4,Its astonishing to me that such an inexpensive Bourbon can hold its own. This has all the right stuff.
4,jadianes,10,5,A really sweet and soft single malt
5,john,0,5,My favorite scotch. No. Questions. Asked.
6,john,1,4,Love it... Luxury!
7,john,3,5,This is a really good smoky flavor whiskey
8,john,9,5,Infinitely better than Jack Daniels for the same price.
9,john,10,5,"This single malt is one of the ingredients of the black label JW, and is really good to be taste just with ice."
10,john,7,4,I love it but I definitely know some scotch drinkers who hate it!
11,mari,0,1,Not my favorite drink. The smokey flavor was too much for me.
12,mari,1,1,This is an acquired taste
13,mari,3,2,Overrated & Not Good
14,mari,5,5,The best !!
15,yasset,0,5,Wonderful stuff - there are some excellent Islays in its price range but this might be the best.
16,yasset,2,2,Maybe the Jameson 18 was good a decade ago when these reviews were written.
17,yasset,3,3,Pretty good
18,yasset,4,5,This is an incredible dram! So smokey and leathery!
19,yasset,6,1,Way too sweet (and I typically like sweet beverages).
20,carlos,0,2,Not my style.
21,carlos,1,1,Disgustingly burnt.
22,carlos,7,3,Sweet with a hint of smoke and a touch of oak.
23,teus,0,4,really good whisky.
24,teus,10,5,This one is for sundays sun and one coffee after...light and simple...taste very good
25,teus,3,5,"Hey, this is great stuff!"
26,teus,5,2,This is your standard poor man's; biker chick; hobo movie prop 'Merican whiskey.
27,lluis,0,5,This is the most complex Scotch I've ever tasted. Very very peaty; quite smokey with notes of tobacco; dark chocolate and sherry.
28,lluis,2,5,Worth my $100 .. very smooth and just beautiful
29,lluis,5,2,"Not so good"
30,lluis,8,4,"Ridiculously smooth on the nose and the tongue, silky and warming"
31,pepe,10,3,"Not nearly the 90 rating it was given. It smelled bitter and wasn't very smooth."
32,pepe,6,1,"An insult to whiskey."
33,pepe,0,5,"There no doubt the angels would come back for another kiss from this oaken cask."
34,pepe,1,5,This is a spectacular Islay malt though not for the faint-hearted.
35,pepe,2,5,"Smooth with hints of toffee in the end. My favorite Irish Whiskey. "
36,pepe,5,1,Disgusting
37,carlos,6,4,I like the sweetness almost on an Amaretto level.
